## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7
- PyTorch 1.9.1
- Torchvision 0.10.1
- pyyaml
- opencv-python
- tensorboard
- tqdm
- lmdb
- scikit-image
- thop
- matplotlib

## Checkpoints and Dataset
Please download the checkpoints and dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rd9bIvsk9DBZaA7LXWGNMZ3SM11-_g8h?usp=sharing).

Our codes use lmdb format. If you would like to use other datasets, please convert them into lmdb format. The details can be found [here](https://github.com/zzh-tech/ESTRNN/blob/master/data/how_to_make_dataset_file.ipynb).

In our CVPR version, the reported GMACs includes a redundant operation. We removed this operation, so the actual GMACs is 325.48.

## Training
To train the model on the downsampled GOPRO dataset, run the below command:
```
python main.py --config config/memdeblur_gopro_ds.yml
```

To train the model on the original GOPRO dataset, run the below command:
```
python main.py --config config/memdeblur_gopro_ori.yml
```


## Evaluation
To evaluate the model on the downsampled GOPRO dataset, please **turn on the `test_only` option in the config file** and run the below command:
```
python main.py --config config/memdeblur_gopro_ds.yml
```

To evaluate the model on the original GOPRO dataset, please **turn on the `test_only` option in the config file** and run the below command:
```
python main.py --config config/memdeblur_gopro_ori.yml
```
As mentioned in Section 4.1, we reduce the memory size by discarding old memories. This feature is automatically turned on as indicated by `test_mem_length: 5 ` in the config file. To turn this feature off and utilize the full memory, please set it to `None`, i.e., `test_mem_length: ~ `.


## TODO
We plan to update the evaluation results on DVD dataset in the near future.
